You are here in the documentation part dedicated to the v1.3.1 release of H2GIS, the spatial extension
of the [H2][] database engine.

## What is H2GIS?

In a nutshell: H2GIS is to [H2][] as [PostGIS][] is to [PostgreSQL][].

H2GIS adds support for

* `(MULTI)POINT`, `(MULTI)LINESTRING` and `(MULTI)POLYGON` types
* the functions specified by the [OpenGIS][] [Simple Features Implementation
  Specification for SQL][] and
* additional spatial functions we develop, including our graph analysis package
  [H2Network][]
